1. Make sure on-call.web.mvc.allowedOriginsCombined includes both http://** and https://** patterns or
only one of them will be used, otherwise some requests will end up with 403 status.

2. private.properties or config vars should include:
    - imgbb.api.key from imgbb.com to use api for storing images
    - on-call.datasource.url, on-call.datasource.username, call.datasource.password for database access (on heroku
it is not necessary, there is DATABASE_URL instead)
    - on-call.jwt.secretKey which is a string of random characters used for encryption
    - on-call.jwt.tokenPrefix used for Authorization header
    - on-call.jwt.tokenExpirationAfterDays to define how long JWT token lives
    - on-call.web.mvc.allowedOriginsCombined to define allowed origins for CORS
